# DeeBee

DeeBee is a collection of code challenge based on [this challenge](https://github.com/WhatsLab/code-challenge)

I will solve the problem starting from the [backend challenge](https://github.com/WhatsLab/code-challenge/blob/master/backend-task.md)

The backend will then be used to crack the [react-native challenge](https://github.com/WhatsLab/code-challenge/blob/master/ReactNative-Challenge.md) however, instead of using react native, I'll crearte 1 Android app and 1 iOS app to display my skills and see how it will work on an end-to-end level.

I'll update this repo as I have more work added
