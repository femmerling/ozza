# Ozza

Ozza is a result of code challenge consisting of backend and front end challenge.

Backend is a python key-value store with HTTP interface.

I'll create a native iOS and a native Android app that will consume the HTTP interface.

Current status:

- [x] Backend
- [ ] iOS Native App
- [ ] Android Native App

I'll update this repo as I have more work added
